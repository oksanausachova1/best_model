# best_model
This code seems to implement a function named best_model that performs a hyperparameter search and model selection process for a given set of models and their parameters. The function is capable of working on both regression and classification problems.

For regression problems, the function tries to optimize the performance of the following models by hyperparameter search:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Lasso
Ridge
K Neighbors Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Ada Boost Regressor
XGB Regressor
The function trains each model with the best set of hyperparameters and calculates R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics on the training and validation sets. Finally, the function generates a plot for each metric for comparison among models.

For classification problems, the function tries to optimize the performance of the following models by hyperparameter search:
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
K Neighbors Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Ada Boost Classifier
XGB Classifier
The function trains each model with the best set of hyperparameters and calculates accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC AUC metrics on the training and validation sets. Finally, the function generates a plot for each metric for comparison among models.

The function takes the following arguments:

features: a pandas dataframe containing the features to be used in the analysis

target: a pandas series containing the target variable for the analysis

mode: a string indicating the type of analysis ('regression' or 'classification')

grid: a string indicating whether a grid search should be performed ('Yes' or 'No')

df: a pandas dataframe containing the features and target variable for visualization purposes

hue: a string indicating the variable to be used for color coding the visualization

models: a list of tuples containing models to be included in the analysis, along with their respective hyperparameters, to override the default models and hyperparameters. If None, default models and hyperparameters will be used.

The function returns a dictionary containing the model names as keys and their respective hyperparameters, trained models, and metrics as values.
These functions generate pair plots of the given dataframe df:
 - for regression problems -  generates a grid of scatterplots in the upper triangle and kernel density estimates in the lower triangle. The scatterplots in the upper triangle show the relationship between each pair of variables, while the kernel density estimates in the lower triangle show the distribution of each variable.

= for classification problems - generates a grid of scatterplots in the upper triangle and annotations of correlation coefficients in the lower triangle. The scatterplots in the upper triangle show the relationship between each pair of variables, while the annotations of correlation coefficients in the lower triangle show the strength and direction of the correlation between each pair of variables.

In both functions, the hue parameter is used to color-code the scatterplots and annotations based on the values of a categorical variable. The sns.regplot function is used to plot a linear regression line in the scatterplots, and the sns.kdeplot function is used to plot the kernel density estimates.
